# Student Registration (WebAppProject)

A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript student registration form with local storage persistence.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — styling
- `script.js` — form logic and localStorage
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run locally
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
   - For best dev experience install the VS Code extension "Live Server" and use it to serve the page.
2. Fill the form and submit. Records are stored in your browser's localStorage.

## Git / GitHub steps
1. Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Open terminal / PowerShell and run:
```bash
cd path/to/WebAppProject
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial website setup"
